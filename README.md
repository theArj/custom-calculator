<!-- Don't Fret: Guitar and Bass Fretboard Calculator determines the number of musical notes that a player is able to play on his or her guitar or bass.

This will allow the beginner musician to know how many octaves his or her instrument is capable of, as well as choose the right instrument for the style of music he or she wants to play.

For example, classical music, most often played on a classical guitar, usually has 19 or 20 frets. This means that the fretboard spans almost 2 octaves, but not quite. Rock and heavy metal guitarists often play higher pitched notes that may require 22 or 24 frets on 6 or 7 string electric guitars. Bass guitar players have the option of 4, 5, or 6 string bass guitars with 21 to 24 frets. A bass guitar with 4 strings is suitable for most classic rock, blues, jazz and some rock music, but does not allow the convenience of the 5th or 6th string that can produce higher pitched notes for bass guitar soloists.

Based on the number strings and the number of frets, this Fretboard Calculator will output the number of notes that the instrument is capable of producing. -->
