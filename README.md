<!-- Don't Fret: Guitar and Bass Fretboard Calculator determines the number of musical notes that an instrument is capable of producing.

This will allow the beginner musician to choose the right instrument for his or her preferred style of music.

For example, classical music is most often played on a nylon 6-string classical guitar, with 19 or 20 frets. This means that the fretboard spans almost 2 octaves, but not quite. Two octaves require 24 frets. Rock and heavy metal guitarists often play higher pitched notes that may require 22 or 24 frets on 6 or 7 string electric guitars. Many folk and some classic rock guitar players use 6-string and 12-string guitars. Guitars will almost never have more than 12 strings.

Bass guitar players have the option of 4-, 5-, or 6-string bass guitars with 21, 22 or 24 frets. Bass guitars usually will not go over 6 strings due to large fretboard width, making it nearly impossible to play. A bass guitar with 4 strings is suitable for most classic rock, blues, jazz and some rock music, but does not allow the convenience of the 5th or 6th string that can produce higher pitched notes for bass guitar soloists. Players who choose 5- or 6-string bass guitars might enjoy neo-jazz, metal and hard rock music.

Based on the number strings and the number of frets, this Fretboard Calculator will output the number of notes that the instrument is capable of producing. This will help newbies choose the right instrument for their preferred style of music. -->
